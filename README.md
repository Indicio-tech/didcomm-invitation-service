## Android Intents
Android Intents work on all the mobile browsers, some browsers will automatically prompt the user instead of requiring a button click on the website (which is preferred):

* [ ] Android Chrome (if only one app is installed matching the scheme or if a specific package/app is defined, Android Chrome will prompt the user)
* [x] Firefox
* [ ] Opera
* [x] Edge

## iOS Universal Links

### Notes:
If the user clicks the link and the app is not installed, the user will be directed to the website, not the app. This likely indicates the app owner should host a webpage providing instructions to install their app.
