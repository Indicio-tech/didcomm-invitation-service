## Android Intent
Android Intents work on all the mobile browsers, some browsers will automatically prompt the user instead of requiring a button click on the website (which is preferred):

* [ ] Android Chrome (if only one app is installed matching the scheme or if a specific package/app is defined, Android Chrome will prompt the user)
* [x] Firefox
* [ ] Opera
* [x] Edge
